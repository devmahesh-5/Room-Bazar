# FACET
Stage	        What It Does            	        Example Use Case

$match	        Filters documents ðŸŽ¯	            { price: { $gte: 100 } } to get expensive items
$group	        Groups by a field & applies 
                aggregations                        { _id: "$category", count: { $sum: 1 } } to count items   per category
$bucket	        Divides values into fixed ranges 	{ boundaries: [0, 50, 100], groupBy: "$price" }
$bucketAuto	    Same as $bucket, but auto-fits
                ranges Useful when you donâ€™t know
                exact boundaries
$facet	        Runs multiple pipelines in parallel    { total: [ { $count: "totalDocs" } ], avgPrice: [ {                                                     $group: {...} } ] }
$unwind	    Flattens arrays into multiple documents	
            Converts { tags: ["A", "B"] } â†’ { tags: "A" }, { tags: "B" }
$count	    Counts total documents at that stage 	      { $count: "total" } at the end to get total count

## Refund Policy

User Requests Refund â†’ Admin Reviews â†’ Notify Owner â†’ Owner Responds â†’ 
   â†“                               â†“
Approve â†’ Release Escrow â†’ Notify User    Reject â†’ Save Reason/Photos â†’ Notify User



- i make a function that sends money according to the reffund status [Approved----> send to user,RejectedByAdmin --->send to Owner]
- when owner approves,refund status:approved, 
- when owner rejects, refund status: rejectedByOwner[in this should provide photos and reason]
- now i see the reason and photos of each refund collection if it is genieune, i send the money to the owner
I use 
//for code, make md 

```javascript

 refundSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
         if(!this.isModified("status")){
            next();
        }else{
            //here call the function for payment
            //function(this)
            next(); 
        }
         });

```

### Payment Modle

- When user clicks book in room then room status change to reserved.
- this creates payment model.(where the data needed for esewa payment is sent as resonse)
- these data is used in frontEnd to make a payment request.
- Redirects to Esewa payment page.
- remember i may need to send html response for esewa payment page when user clicks book.
- User makes payment.
- Esewa sends Response,if Sucess,it is redirected to success page where i make a patch request with transaction uuid [it is set in backend as query parameter in sucess_url] of the payment to handleSucess where status is modified to success.
- then,if the the status is modified,change the status of the room to booked f status of payment is sucess.(get roomid from payment model).
- else room status change to available.
